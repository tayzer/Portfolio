# My Git Cheatsheet

This is a guide to my most-used Git commands.

## Common Commands

* `git pull`: Fetch and merge changes from remote
* `git push`: Send local commits to remote
* `git status`: Check the status of your working tree

### Branching

1.  Create a new branch: `git checkout -b new-feature-branch`
2.  Switch to a branch: `git checkout main`
