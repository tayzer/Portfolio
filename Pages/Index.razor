    <h1>Hey, I'm <span class="highlight">Taylor</span></h1>
    
    <p>
        I'm a <span class="highlight">passionate developer</span> with over a decade of experience building 
        <strong>clean web applications</strong> and <strong>efficient backend systems</strong>—and occasionally, 
        completely random stuff that sparks my curiosity.
    </p>

    <p>
        I originally set out to become a game designer, but stumbled into software development by chance. 
        It stuck. Whether it was the "right" path, I honestly couldn't say—but I genuinely love what I do, 
        and that counts for something.
    </p>

    <p>
        What drives me most is <span class="highlight">writing clean, readable code</span> that's easy to 
        debug and maintain. I say "drives" rather than "achieve" because development is an endless journey 
        of learning and refinement. A decision that seemed perfect yesterday might look questionable today. 
        That's the beauty of it—I'm constantly evolving my craft, embracing new approaches, and staying 
        current with industry standards.
